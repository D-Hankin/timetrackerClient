# Time Tracker

## Overview
This is a timekeeping program developed for a school project with Jönköping University. The project consists of a client-side application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. The application allows users to create accounts, start activities, track the duration of each activity, and maintains a record of these activities.

## Deployment
The client-side application is deployed live and accessible at https://sea-lion-app-6y5s4.ondigitalocean.app/

## Features
- User authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely.
- Activity tracking: Users can create, start and stop activities, and the application tracks the duration of each activity.
- Data storage: Activity data is mananged through the API and stored using MongoDB Atlas.
- User-friendly interface: The application features an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- Vite: Fast build tool for modern web development.
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality and developer productivity.
- Java: Backend development for server-side logic and database communication.
- MongoDB Atlas: Document based database storage 

## Server Connection
The client-side application is connected to the Time Tracker server. The server repository can be found [here](https://github.com/D-Hankin/timetracker_server), and the live server is hosted at [https://urchin-app-gt5j7.ondigitalocean.app](https://urchin-app-gt5j7.ondigitalocean.app).

## Usage
To run the client-side application locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Open your web browser and go to the localhost port given after start-up to view the application.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
